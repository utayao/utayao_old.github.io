In this post I'll share some of my experiences building my personal academic website. I started with the following requirements:

* I had never built a decent webpage before and I didn't want to spend a lot of time learning.
* I wanted **free hosting without ads**.
* The page should contain a **blog**.
* **Easy-to-mantain publications** page.
* It should look well both in mobiles and computers.
* I wanted the solution to be as **long-lasting** as possible.

I started by searching for "free web hosting" at Google, and so I started by exploring sites like [Weebly](weebly.com). It was free (for my current needs), easy to use, acceptably customizable, and looked good on mobiles. The problem for me were the long-term implications of hosting and editing everything on a *closed* site: what if my expectations from the web change in the future? Would I be able to export all the work put into it if the conditions for the service change?

<br />
I ended up finding [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), which allowed me to host my page for free, and edit everything locally through git. Awesome! But then how to create a nice webpage with a blog? (Remember I am a completely newbie at this)... yep, I've seen that I should use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), but I also want my site to look nice! Thankfully, I came across an awesome template, called [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), that was a good starting point. The same author has another theme [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme), big kudos to [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes)!

<br />
The only thing I needed, therefore, was to fork the Minimal Mistakes repository into a new repository in my git, with the name:
	
`username.github.io `<br />
I did some small changes, I pushed them to github, and *voil√†*! My page was up and running! So far I had fulfilled all constraints but one: having an easy-to-mantain publications page. Let's get to it!
