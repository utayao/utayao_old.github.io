This page will show my solution for the DSB 2017 Challenge. I will do better after chanllenge.

my customary update of percentage of <i>deep-learning papers</i> in the major vision conferences. At CVPR 2015, I described its [exponential growth]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-scraping/), and after ICCV 2015 I wondered whether it had [plateaued]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-plateau/).<br>
<br>
<del>Since the CVF has not released the papers yet, I had to adapt my script to take the titles from the program.</del>
[UPDATE] CVF papers are online, so we can use the generic script shown below.<br>
<br>
You can download all titles in TXT format in [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nhsric6bksopot3/AADz3BWN6I8i1VsDNLOpvdDAa?dl=0) 

And the plot using XKCD style, as described in this [blog post]({{ site.url }}/xkcd-deep-learning/):
