I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, the University of Texas at Arlington. I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Junzhou Huang](http://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/).

<br />
My research focuses on the deep learning with its applications especially for medical imaging and Health Informatics. I am doing research on survival prediction which can help doctors to make treatment decision using patients' big Imaging Genomics data. I am very passionate about AI in medicine and wish to dedicate my work to benefit people.
